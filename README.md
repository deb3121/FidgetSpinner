I have create a very simple game based on a fidget spinner. The logic of the game is that the turns will keep increasing as you press the space bar, and it will reduce its speed and stop at a point where you stop pressing the space bar.
To create a game with Python based on the above logic of a fidget spinner I will use the Turtle module in Python
So keep pressing the space bar to increase the speed and release the bar to slow down the speed.
